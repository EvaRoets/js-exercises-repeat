            <p>In this exercise I want you to learn how to take full advantage of JS functions. Use the console to verify your code.

            <ol>
                BASICS
                <li>select the author of Baiana
                </li>
                <li>log all song titles
                </li>
                <li>use the find function to select the song by Rammstein
                </li>
                <li>do the same to select all songs by Bakermat. Is the find function the right choice here? If not, what would be a better one? (don't use for or foreach)
                </li><br/>
                INTERMEDIATE
                <li>log all pop songs</li>
                <li>write a function that always returns the first song (full object is okay)
                </li>
                <li>write a function that will return a song at the index of your chosing. You may not use a global var for this index
                </li>
                <li>write a function that will return a random song. Use a separate function for the random selection
                </li><br/>
                ADVANCED
                <li>write a function that will suggest you a random song from a genre of your chosing. You may use any techniques you want, but try to think about which ones make most sense
                </li>
                <li>write a function that will show all songs (full object is okay) that fit your moment choice. Use the filter function
                </li>
                <li>sort all songs from a certain genre alphabetically. You may not use for or foreach
                </li><br/>
                MASTER
                <li>write a function that will show all songs by a certain author. It should be possible to search on parts of the name (e.g. a search for "baker" should return two songs)
                </li>
                <li>write a function that asks for your moment and genre preference and returns the title of all song matching your criteria. Use the filter function
                </li>
                <li>write a function that asks for your moment and genre preference and returns the title of all song matching your criteria. If a preference is not given, then no filter is applied for that category
                </li>
                <li>get a list of all the possible moments related to the songs. No duplicate moments may exist
                </li><br/>
                OVER 9000
                <li>write a function that will search for songs based on author, genre and moment. Use an object called searchCriteria to contain these
                </li><br/>
                OVERACHIEVER
                <li>start a band and write a song that you hear once, and is in your mind for the rest of the day. We've all suffered from those, right? Get world-famous. Earn millions. Resist a path leading to the 26th club. Get into IT. Replace the songs in the list with your own.</li>
